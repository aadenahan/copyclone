    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Well hello there! My name is Max Tuchman, as you may have guessed. I’m a Publisher, Programmer, Designer, and all around lover of technology!<p/>

<p>Growing up I fell in love with two things: games and programming. Putting those two together, and I quickly found myself modding games. I didn’t do too much with any significance. I tried my hand at plenty of things early on: QuakeWorld, Half-Life, Red Faction, Homeworld 2, etc. Eventually I found myself wanting to mod games that simply weren’t built for it, or were unsupported by the developers. I tried until I made things work, if I could at all. Spending many years doing that, I’ve built up a skill set and a passion for pulling apart any game that I enjoy in my free time. If I’ve played and enjoyed it, I’ve probably done something with it. Nearly all of what I do as a hobby in my spare time with games is directly what I myself am interested in.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to hire me, just shoot me an email, I’ll get back to you asap. <u>hire@mbtuchman.com</u></p>

<p>If you simply want some advice, help, etc. contact me here <u>me@mbtuchman.com</u></p>
